# RayTracing
RayTracing is a software that aims to accomplish two main objectives: visualizing ray trajectories and generating 3D image renders.

## Features (still working on!)

- Ray Trajectory Visualization: RayTracing provides a powerful tool to visualize the path of rays as they interact with objects in a 3D scene. This feature allows users to gain insights into how light rays behave and interact with different materials.

- 3D Image Rendering: In addition to ray trajectory visualization, RayTracing offers the capability to generate high-quality 3D image renders. By simulating the behavior of light rays, the software can produce realistic and visually appealing images of 3D scenes.

# Project Background
This project emerged as the final assignment for the Computational Optics course of the Master's in Physical Engineering at the University of Aveiro, Portugal.
